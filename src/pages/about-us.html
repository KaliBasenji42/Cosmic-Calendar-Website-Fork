    <h2>Who Are We</h2>
    <p class="info graybac">
        We are a group of dedicated students from various schools across the Denver area who came together at Warren Tech with a shared passion for computers, engineering, and innovation. 
        Our diverse backgrounds and skill levels make us a unique team, united by our eagerness to learn and grow in this ever-evolving field. 
        Together, we decided to join the HUNCH program as an opportunity to challenge ourselves, collaborate on meaningful projects, and showcase our abilities. 
        While some of us are just beginning to explore software development and learning new programming languages, we are driven by curiosity, perseverance, and a commitment to contributing to something greater. 
        Through HUNCH, we aim to push our boundaries, enhance our technical skills, and make an impact through teamwork and creative problem-solving.

    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p class="info">
        Our mission is to design an accurate and seamless system for translating Earth-based time into planetary calendars. 
        This innovative solution will address the challenges of synchronizing time across different planetary systems, enabling more effective interplanetary exploration and communication. 
        By developing a reliable platform, we aim to empower astronauts, scientists, and space agencies to coordinate operations, share data, and collaborate with ease, regardless of their location in the solar system. 
        Our work will play a vital role in supporting humanity's next steps into space, ensuring timekeeping is no longer a barrier to discovery and progress.
